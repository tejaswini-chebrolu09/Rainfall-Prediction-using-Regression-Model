# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Regression-Model
This project leverages historical rainfall data in India from 1901 to 2015 to predict future rainfall using various regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Ridge, and Lasso. The project includes an interactive Gradio interface that allows users to select a model, input a year and month, and receive a rainfall prediction.
